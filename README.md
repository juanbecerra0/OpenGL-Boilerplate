# OpenGL-Boilerplate

Boilerplate code for developing 32-bit graphical projects in Windows. Utilizes the GLEW API to create a context for the OpenGL API. This code was developed by following "The Cherno's" OpenGL tutorial series on YouTube, which can be found here:

If by the off-chance that someone other than myself is using this boilerplate, please consider supporting his Patreon. He produces some great content about C++, OpenGL, and game engine development:

Many features, like index buffers, vertex arrays, and shader compilation, are abstracted into their own modules in order to make basic graphics projects less complicated and bloated.

With the nature of Visual Studio 2019 projects, this repo is a bit bloated with old blob executables. I'll be trying to clean up some of my mess going forward ;)
